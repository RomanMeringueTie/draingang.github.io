                was released on 17 March 2022 via Year0001, as a follow-up to the duo's previous single
                "Amygdala".The album was "recorded amongst nature", with Bladee, Ecco2K, and producer
                Whitearmor driving to the edge of Sweden and recording in a cabin not far from where Ingmar Bergman's
                fantasy epic The Seventh Seal was filmed.</p>

                Gang,
                released on 12 September 2019 through Year0001. It is sung by Bladee, Ecco2K and Thaiboy Digital, and
                all songs were produced by Whitearmor, with "Acid Rain" and "You Lose" also being produced by Mechatok
                and Lusi, respectively. The song "1:1" features Yung Lean. It was recorded in a visit to Bangkok,
                Thailand, as Thaiboy Digital was deported from Stockholm in 2015 due to visa complications. The artwork
                was done by Ecco2K.</p>

            <p id="4" class="releases__text">Whitearmor's latest album, consisting of 10 tracks, is not just a
                compilation of
                good songs. It is a musical journey that is purposefully put together, showcasing Whitearmor's distinct
                production style and aesthetic. As a fan of Whitearmor, I find that this album lives up to the high
                standard set by his previous works and stands out as the only Whitearmor album as of 2023. The standout
                features of this album are all within it's production. The album's production is reminiscent of
                Whitearmor's previous works like Crest and 333, while also incorporating his iconic sound selection. It
                deviates from Whitearmor's earlier work as Dj Cannabiz, which was inspired by Clams Casino, and
                highlights Whitearmor's uniqueness as a producer. The album takes a departure from the clams casino
                inspired tape that marked the beginning of his career, and we are able to witness his evolution as an
                artist.</p>
